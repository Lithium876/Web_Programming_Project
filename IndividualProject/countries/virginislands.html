			<h2>Then: <i>Emile Alphonse Griffith</i></h2>
				<p style="font-family:verdana"><img src="../../images/emile.jpg" align="left" hspace="10">
					Emile Alphonse Griffith (February 3, 1938 - July 23, 2013) was a professional boxer from the U.S. Virgin Islands who became a world champion in the welterweight and middleweight classes. His best known contest was a 1962 title match with Benny Paret. At the weigh in, Paret infuriated Griffith by touching his buttocks and calling him a homosexual. Griffith won the bout by knockout; Paret never recovered consciousness and died in the hospital 10 days later.<br>
				</p>
				<p style="font-family:verdana">
					Griffith as a youth never dreamed of becoming a boxer and was discovered by accident. As a teen he was working at a hat factory on a steamy day when his boss, the factory owner, agreed to Griffith's request to work shirtless. When the owner, a former amateur boxer, noticed his frame he took Griffith to trainer Gil Clancy's gym.<br>
				</p>
				<p style="font-family:verdana">
					Griffith won the 1958 New York Golden Gloves 147 lb Open Championship. Griffith defeated Osvaldo Marcano of the Police Athletic Leagues Lynch Center in the finals to win the Championship. In 1957 Griffith advanced to the finals of the 147 lb Sub-Novice division and was defeated by Charles Wormley of the Salem Crescent Athletic Club. Griffith trained at the West 28th Street Parks Department Gym in New York City.<br>

				<h2>Now: <i>John Jackson</i></h2>
				<p style="font-family:verdana"><img src="../../images/john.jpg" alt="John Jackson" align="left" hspace="10">
					John Jackson (born January 16, 1989) is a professional boxer from the Virgin Islands who qualified for, and boxed in, the 2008 Olympics at welterweight. He is one of the sons of boxer Julian Jackson, and his brother Julius Jackson qualified at light-heavyweight.<br>
				</p>
				<p style="font-family:verdana">
					At the PanAm Games in 2007 his first bout was against favourite Demetrius Andrade and was beaten 5:23. At the 2007 World Championships he again lost in the first round, this time to Aliasker Bashirov.<br>
				</p>
				<p style="font-family:verdana">
					At the first Olympic qualifier in March 2008, however, he defeated Argentinian Diego Chaves and PanAm Champion Pedro Lima 19:10 to qualify. He lost to Cuban Carlos Banteaux, but this did not affect his qualification. In Beijing he upset Magomed Nurutdinov 4:2 but lost 0:10 to Kim Jung-Joo.<br>
				</p>
				<p style="font-family:verdana">
					He turned pro in 2009. As of 7, June 2014, his professional record is 18 wins with 15 coming via the way of knockout; 2 losses and no draws. Having only lost a controversial decision to Willie Nelson and lost on a 5th round KO to Andy Lee.<br>

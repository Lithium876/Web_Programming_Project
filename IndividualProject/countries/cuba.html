				<h2>Then: <i>Jos&eacute;  de la Caridad M&eacute;ndez</i></h2>
				<p style="font-family:verdana"><img src="../../images/jose.jpg" align="left" hspace="15">
					Jos&eacute;  de la Caridad M&eacute;ndez (March 19, 1887 - October 31, 1928) was a Cuban right-handed pitcher and manager in baseball's Negro Leagues. Born in C&aacute;rdenas, Matanzas, he died at age 41 in Havana. Known in Cuba as El Diamante Negro (the "Black Diamond"), he became a legend in his homeland. He was one of the first group of players elected to the Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame in 1939. He was elected to the U.S. National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006.<br>
				</p>
				<p style="font-family:verdana">
					In 1907 M&eacute;ndez was discovered by Beb&eacute; Royer of the Almendares team in the Cuban League. A relatively small man (5 feet, 10 inches, 152 pounds), he threw a hard fast ball with a deceptively easy motion and a snapping curve. His first Cuban League season (from January through March 1908), he went 9-0, and, along with veteran Jose&iacute;to Mu&ntilde;oz, led the Almendares Blues to the Cuban League pennant. That summer he made his United States debut with the Cuban Stars and also went 3-0 for the Brooklyn Royal Giants.<br>
				</p>
				<p style="font-family:verdana">
					In the fall of 1908, in the middle of the Second Occupation of Cuba, M&eacute;ndez pitched the games that established him as a legend. The Cincinnati Reds were visiting Havana playing the Cuban League teams, and M&eacute;ndez completely dominated, pitching 25 consecutive scoreless innings in 3 appearances. In his first start, he allowed just one single, by Miller Huggins in the 9th inning, while striking out nine. His next appearance came in relief, where he held the Reds scoreless for 7 innings on just 2 hits. He concluded with another shutout. His record from the Cincinnati Reds series was W-2, L-0, ERA-0.00, G-3, IP-25, H-8, R-0, BB-3, SO-24. Several days later Almendares played a minor league all-star team from Key West, and M&eacute;ndez pitched two more shutouts, the second a no-hitter, giving him 43 consecutive scoreless innings against major and minor league competition.<br>

				<h2>Now: <i>H&eacute;ctor Olivera</i></h2>
				<p style="font-family:verdana"><img src="../../images/hector.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" height="200" width="200">
					H&eacute;ctor Olivera (born April 5, 1985) is a Cuban baseball player in the Los Angeles Dodgers organization. He was part of the Cuban team which won a silver medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. He is ranked as the number 6 player still in Cuba by Baseball America and plays second base.<br> 
				</p>
				<p style="font-family:verdana">
					Olivera played for the Santiago de Cuba team in the Cuban National Series from 2003 through 2014 and hit .323 with 96 home runs and 433 runs batted in for them. He missed the entire 2012-13 season due to a blood disorder, which also limited him defensively during the 2013-14 season.<br>
				</p>
				<p style="font-family:verdana">
					In addition, he played for the Cuba national baseball team at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, 2007 and 2009 Baseball World Cups, the 2010 Intercontinental Cup, the 2011 Pan American Games and the 2009 World Baseball Classic.<br>
				</p>
				<p style="font-family:verdana">
					Olivera defected from Cuba in September 2014, to pursue a career in Major League Baseball, establishing his residence in Haiti. His potential drew many scouts to his showcase in the Dominican Republic, where he was said to be in good physical condition with a quick bat and above average power.<br>

			<h2>Then: <i>Donald O'Riley Quarrie</i></h2>
			<p style="font-family:verdana"><img src="../../images/don.jpg" alt="Donald Quarrie" align="left" hspace="10">
				Donald O'Riley Quarrie CD (born 25 February 1951) is a former Jamaican track and field athlete, one of the world's top sprinters during the 1970s. At the 1976 Summer Olympics he was the gold medallist in the Olympic 200 meters and silver medallist in the Olympic 100 meters. In all, he competed in five Olympic Games and won four Olympic medals during his career.<br>
			</p>
			<p style="font-family:verdana" >
				He equalled the 200 meters world record in 1971 and equalled the 100 metres world record in 1976. He has lifetime bests of 10.07 seconds and 19.86 seconds for the events.<br>
			</p>
			<p style="font-family:verdana">
				He won 100 metres/200 metres sprint doubles at the 1970 Commonwealth Games, 1971 Pan American Games, and 1974 Commonwealth Games. He was the first male to defend either the 100 m or 200 m title at the Commonwealth Games and a 100 m win at the 1978 Commonwealth Games makes him the only person to have won that title three times. He won nine gold medals in the sprints at the Central American and Caribbean Championships in Athletics from 1971 to 1981.<br>
			</p>
			<p style="font-family:verdana">
				He has received recognition both on and off the field. He was a five-time winner at the Jamaican Sports person of the Year and a statue of him is positioned at the entrance to Jamaica's National Stadium. There is also a school (Donald Quarrie High School) that bears his name in Eastern Kingston. Reggae artists have paid respect to his achievements with songs including "Tribute to Donald Quarrie", one by Joe Gibbs and The Guerrillas and one by Bongo Herman.<br>

			<h2>Now: <i>Usain St. Leo Bolt</i></h2>
			<p style="font-family:verdana"><img src="../../images/bolt.jpg" align="left" hspace="10">
				Usain St. Leo Bolt, OJ, CD (born 21 August 1986), is a Jamaican sprinter. Widely regarded as the fastest person ever,he is the first man to hold both the 100 metres and 200 metres world records since fully automatic time measurements became mandatory in 1977. Along with his teammates, he also set the world record in the 4x100 metres relay. He is the reigning Olympic champion in these three events, the first man to win six Olympic gold medals in sprinting, and an eight-time World champion. He was the first to achieve a "double double" by winning 100 m and 200 m titles at consecutive Olympics (2008 and 2012),and topped this through the first "double triple" (including 4x100 m relays).<br>
			</p>
			<p style="font-family:verdana">
				Although gaining worldwide popularity for a sprint double victory at the Beijing Games, Bolt has had more victories as a 200 m runner. While he had not won any significant 100 m title prior to the 2008 Olympics, he had won numerous crowns in the 200 m event at the youth, junior and senior levels. Further, at the 2013 World Championships in Moscow, Bolt completed a hat-trick of 200 m world titles by winning his third straight gold in the event. His 2009 record breaking margin for 100 m, from 9.69 seconds (his own previous world record) to 9.58, is the highest since the start of fully automatic time measurements.<br>
			</p>
			<p style="font-family:verdana">
				Bolt's achievements in sprinting have earned him the media nickname "Lightning Bolt", and awards including the IAAF World Athlete of the Year, Track & Field Athlete of the Year, and Laureus World Sportsman of the Year (three times). He is the highest paid athlete ever in track and field. He has been called the world's most marketable athlete. By winning three gold medals at the 2013 World Championships, Bolt became one of the most successful athletes in the 30-year history of the athletics world championships.<br>
			</p>
			<p style="font-family:verdana">
				On 14 February 2015, Bolt announced that he intends to retire from athletics after the 2017 World Championships in London.<br>
